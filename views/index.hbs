                        Bondfire is an app that allows artists to create meaningful experiences with their fans by schedule unique and secure on-demand meetups.
                        Through the app, artists can create events and sell tickets to fans. Where we shine is working with partner locations to allow to reserve
                        a space at a venue on the fly for free enabling us to take care of all the security and logistics of the event.
                        All the artist has to do is fill out a form and show up, we make it that easy.

                        I started this project at a Google Startupathon hackathon where we won, later I continued user interviewing artists and decided to pursue the idea.
                        I found a teammate to help me pick up the back end skills as I did all the front end design and development as well as leading the busines development, sales and marketing.
                        We were accepted into the 2018 Future Founders Residency, worked out of the 1871 startup incubator and were apart of MIT's latest nationwide startup year long research.
